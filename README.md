# 5-Axis 3D Printer Controller for Arduino (Marlin-based)

## Overview

source code and configuration files for a 5-axis 3D printer controller designed to run on Arduino boards using the Marlin firmware. The controller extends the capabilities of traditional 3D printers by adding support for two additional axes, enabling more complex and intricate prints.

## Features

- **Expanded Capabilities:** Redefine your 3D printing projects with support for five axes, providing unprecedented freedom for intricate and complex designs.

- **Marlin Compatibility:** Harness the reliability and versatility of the Marlin firmware, a trusted standard in the 3D printing community, ensuring seamless integration with a diverse range of 3D printers and components.

- **Arduino Board Compatibility:** Tailored for popular Arduino boards, the firmware offers a user-friendly and accessible solution for enhancing your existing 3D printing setup.

- **Configurability at Your Fingertips:** Easily customize and fine-tune the firmware to match the exact specifications of your 5-axis 3D printer. Adjust motor steps, acceleration, and other critical parameters through intuitive configuration files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
- Compatible Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Mega 2560).
- 3D printer with 5-axis support.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/5-axis-3d-printer-controller.git
    ```

2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.

3. Tailor the firmware to your needs by editing the `Configuration.h` and other relevant configuration files.

4. Upload the firmware to your Arduino board.

## Configuration

Refine your experience by adjusting the configuration files to match your unique 5-axis 3D printer setup. Key configuration files include:

- `Configuration.h`: Fine-tune fundamental settings like motor steps, acceleration, and printer dimensions.

- `pins.h`: Define the pin mappings for your specific hardware configuration.
